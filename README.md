## üöÄ Projects
- **Lung Sound Classification**
Technologies: Python, Librosa, Azure ML Studio, Snowflake.
During my term in Sonavi Labs, I worked on a project to classify breathing sounds, focusing on distinguishing wheezes and crackles. I processed and cleaned audio data, separating breathing and heartbeat sounds to ensure accurate classification. Using models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), decision trees, and random forests, I achieved an accuracy of 82%, optimizing further through data augmentation techniques such as adding noise, altering pitch, and introducing echo effects. The entire process, including model building, testing, and deployment, was conducted on Azure ML Studio, making it a valuable hands-on learning experience in machine learning and sound classification.
